    <h1>Dear Srila Prabhupäda,</h1>
    <p>Please accept my prostrated obeisances at your lotus feet. All glories to Your Divine Grace.</p>
    <p><strong>nama om vishnu-padaya krishna-preshthaya bhu-tale srimate bhaktivedanta-svamin iti namine namas te saraswate deve gaura-vani-pracarine nirvishesha-shunyavadi-pashchatya-desha-tarine</strong></p>
    <p>The following verse translation from chapter 18 of your Nectar of Devotion continues to resonate with me:</p>
    <blockquote>
        “I have no love for Krsna, nor for the causes of developing love of Krsna—namely, hearing and chanting. And the process of bhakti-yoga, by which one is always thinking of Krsna and fixing His lotus feet in the heart, is also lacking in me. As far as philosophical knowledge or pious works are concerned, I don’t see any opportunity for me to execute such activities. But above all, I am not even born of a nice family. Therefore I must simply pray to You, Gopijana-vallabha [Krsna, maintainer and beloved of the gopis]. I simply wish and hope that some way or other I may be able to approach Your lotus feet, and this hope is giving me pain, because I think myself quite incompetent to approach that transcendental goal of life.”
    </blockquote>
<p>In the previous paragraph you explain: The strong conviction that one will certainly receive the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called in Sanskrit asa-bandha. Äsä-bandha means to continue to think, “Because I’m trying my best to follow the routine principles of devotional service, I am sure that I will go back to Godhead, back to home.” In Srimad-Bhägavatam 1.1.1, Krsna’s quality of independence is stated by the use of the word svarat. It is up to His independent will as to whether one achieves spiritual perfection or remains immersed in His illusory energy. I can understand that I am undeserving of His awarding me pure devotional service. However, Bhakti is the property of pure devotees and has been given Her independence by Krsna to manifest Herself when the pure devotee wishes. You are such a repository of Bhakti. My great hope, trust, and faith is based upon my relationship with you. In The Nectar of Devotion, we find that one quality of pure devotion is that it is the only means for attracting and controlling Krsna. Therefore, by your will I will certainly  7 attain perfection. Following Narottama däsa Thakura, one should aspire to be a servant of the Lord’s servant, life after life. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thäkura also sings, tumi ta’ öhäkura, tomära kukkura, baliyä jänaha more: <blockquote>“O my Lord, O Vaisnava, please consider me your dog.”</blockquote> One must become the dog of a Vaisnava, a pure devotee, for a pure devotee can deliver Krsna without difficulty. Krsna se tomära, krsna dite pära. Krsna is the property of His pure devotee, and if we take shelter of a pure devotee, he can deliver Krsna very easily. [SrimadBhägavatam 7.9.42, purport] My one-pointed dedication is to please you. Your mood in relationship to your spiritual master is the guiding light of my life. <blockquote>"Personally, I have no hope for any direct service for the coming crores of births of the sojourn of my life, but I am confident that someday or other I shall be delivered from this mire of delusion in which I am at present so deeply sunk. Therefore let me with all my earnestness pray at the lotus feet of my divine master to allow me to suffer the lot for which I am destined due to my past misdoings, but to let me have this power of recollection: that I am nothing but a tiny servant of the Almighty Absolute Godhead, realized through the unflinching mercy of my divine master. Let me therefore bow down at his lotus feet with all the humility at my command.</blockquote> [From “The Universal Teacher,” Srila Prabhupäda’s Vyäsa-püjä offering read to members of the Gaudiya Matha in Bombay, February 1936]. Please let me always remain in that consciousness, always serving you in your association. That is my spiritual perfection—to serve you eternally.</p> 
    <p>Your servant, Bir Krishna däs Goswami</p>
