    <h1>Dear Srila Prabhupada,</h1>
<p>Please accept my prostrated obeisances at your lotus feet. All glories to Your Divine Grace!</p>
<p>Because of the departure of your dear disciple and my closest friend Bhakti Chäru Swami, this year has been challenging. We had been working together in Your Divine Grace’s service for many years. Philosophically we can understand the temporary nature of this world, but when it comes to experiencing the separation from Vaisnavas, strong emotions naturally overwhelm us.</p>
In helping the disciples of Bhakti Chäru Swami deal with his departure, I have been reminded of the trauma I experienced when you departed this mortal world. I keep remembering the instructions you give in the Fourth Canto of Srimad-Bhägavatam regarding a disciple’s mood when the spiritual master enters into Krsna’s eternal pastimes: Similarly, a devoted disciple of the spiritual master would rather die with the spiritual master than fail to execute the spiritual master’s mission. [Srimad-Bhägavatam 4.28.50, purport] And When one becomes serious to follow the mission of the spiritual master, his resolution is tantamount to seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As explained before, this means meeting the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the instruction of the spiritual master. This is technically called vani-sevä.
<p>Narottama Däsa Thäkura, in his prayer to the departed Vaisnavas, states:<blockquote> All at once they have gone to join Lord Gauräìga, the great dancer. To reach such a perfect personality as Lord Caitanya I can only break my head against the stone in the anguish of separation. They have all gone off together in their own lilä. Narottama Däsa says, “Unable to obtain their association, I must simply weep.”</blockquote> [Ye Anilo Prema-dhana]</p>
<p>Srila Visvanätha Cakravarti Thäkura states in his Bhagavad-gitä commentary on the verse beginning vyavasäyätmikä buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana, Bg. 2.41, that one should serve the words of the spiritual master. The disciple must stick to whatever the spiritual master orders. Simply by following on that line, one sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead. [Srimad Bhägavatam 4.28.51, purport]</p>
<p>My realization of your words deepens with time. Not only do I need to be focused on serving your mission with my body, mind, and words, but I need to ensure that
your mission will continue and increase with succeeding generations of devotees. With the passage of time my own bodily mortality becomes more apparent. I pray to you that I will not fall into the illusion of seeing others pass away and thinking it will not happen to me.</p>
<p><strong>ahani bhütäni gacchantéha yamälayam
sesah sthävaram icchanti kim äçcaryam atah param</strong></p>
<blockquote>“Every moment, every second, every day, every night there are so many hundreds and thousands of living entities going to the temple of death, or dying. But one who is living is thinking that ‘I will not die. I will live for good.’ That is the most wonderful thing in this world.”</blockquote>
<p>I must endeavor to ensure that your legacy will remain prominent in this world. This is not an easy task. It requires that the understanding of your words, your example, your vision, and your intention be figuratively “carved in stone” in your ISKCON society. We must learn how to apply this understanding in changing times. In this way we can satisfy you by helping you create a spiritual revolution in the impious civilizations of this world.</p>
<p>Srila Prabhupäda, please give me the intelligence and strength to work together with your other followers to accomplish this.</p>
Your servant,<br>
Bir Krishna das Goswami
